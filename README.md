# Human Resource Machine

[Human Resource Machine](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine "Game Homepage") machine is an assembly based puzzle game. You are given a series of tasks to complete and the bare minimum of instructions to do so. There are also challenges to complete, how fast can you finish the puzzle and what is the least number of instructions you can use? This combines for a fun and compelling way to stretch your micro-optimizing limits.

This respository contains my solutions to all of the puzzles in Human Resource Machine.

The files in this repository are split into four separate folders: *Orange*, *Blue*, *Green*, and *Achievements*. The colored folders contain the solutions to each of their matching puzzles. The solution files are named according to the following format:

	(N)-(Name)<-Speed | -Size>.asm  

**N**: Number of the puzzle  
**Name**: Name of the puzzle  
**-Speed**: Optimum assembly for the speed challenge  
**-Size**: Optimum assembly for the size challenge  

The  *Achievements* folder is slightly different. This folder contains the solutions to the Steam achievements for this game. That folder has a file detailing what puzzle the solution should be executed on in order to earn the achievement. These files are named according to this format: 

	(N)-(Achievement).asm

**N**: Number of the puzzle  
**Achievement**: Name of the Steam achievement
